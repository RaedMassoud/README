Hi, Iâ€™m RaedMassoud. An aspiring computer scientist.
I picked up my first programming language in 10th grade with the help of a Harvard University online course. Ever since I have been addicted to exploring and learning the magic we can create in this field of study. I believe that the power of programming lies in its ability to create solutions that can solve real-world problems. Since my first introduction to coding, I have worked on several projects that have challenged me to think outside the box and find innovative solutions to complex problems. I am excited to continue exploring this field and see where my passion for programming takes me in the future.
